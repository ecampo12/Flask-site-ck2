# flask-site-ck2
Flask site created for QCC ET-710 for my final project

The requirements.txt has all the dependencies you need to run, simply run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in a terminal to install them.
I recommend creating a virtual python environment and installing the dependencies there.
Once everything is installed, run 'python run.py' or 'python3 run.py' to start the web app.

navigate to 'localhost:5000' in a web browser to view the site.

feel free to change and play around with it as you please!
